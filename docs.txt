Theme Specific:

The theme code itself comes with proper comments allowing you to easily find and modify specific parts of the website without having to examine much of it.

The CSS file does make use of CSS variables to control the color scheme of the site, they are located at the very top of the CSS main file "style.css" and to change the color scheme of the website the only thing you need is to change its values:

Primary Color: #4472a3
Primary Color (Darker/Hover): #3a638e
Dark Color: #333333;

As for the CSS file, all sections of it are divided in sections for easy customization although it is recommended that instead of modifying the main css file a new file is created and applied for modifying/overwriting existing classes.
